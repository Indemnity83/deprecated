Tiny Launcher
============

A tiny Minecraft launcher and updater, very useful for custom server configurations that may require maintaining a client endpoint with frequent changes.

Parts of the launcher are based on the work by Forkk and contributers to the MultiMC4 project, which is a more general purpose Minecraft launcher, and an amazing application.
