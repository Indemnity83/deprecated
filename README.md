This repository houses old projects and code that has been depricated. I don't want to leave it hanging around cluttering up a list of active project, but at the same time I don't want to loose the code and history so any old projects are merged into a new branch of this repository.

### Credits
The idea and method for this repo is based on [GitHub Spring Cleaning - the Deprecation Hack](http://kvz.io/blog/2014/02/21/how-to-deprecate-projects-on-github/) by Kevin van Zonneveld

### Contributing

These projects are depircated meaning I don't plan on supporting them anymore and as such all issues and pull requests are disabled. If you want to take over a project feel free, I'd love to know about it and will even point to it from this readme (or the readme of the branch as apporpirate), just drop an email to indemnity83@gmail.com. Thanks!

### License

Each project has its own license, check there first. If there is no license listed I hereby release my portion of the code as [public domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain_software)
